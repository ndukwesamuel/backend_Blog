so the first thing we will do is to send the is to bring in boostrap in to django


==> step 2 
we want to create a post form


view {
        
class BlogCreateView(CreateView):
    model = Post
    template_name = "create.html"
    fields = "__all__"


}

url  {
    path('create/', BlogCreateView.as_view(), name='create'),

}
